# Price Prediction with Linear Regression
A prediction model is created using linear regression to predict the price of a car depending on various variables such as the car company, model, fuel type, year, and distance travelled.

The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars, including their company, model, fuel type, year of manufacture, and distance travelled. It also includes the corresponding prices of the cars.
