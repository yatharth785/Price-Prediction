# Price Prediction with Linear Regression
The project focuses on predicting the prices of cars based on various relevant factors. The goal of the project is to build a model that can accurately estimate the market value of a car based on these features, allowing car buyers and sellers to make more informed decisions. The data is analyzed and developed using a linear regression model.

This project's dataset comprises information about several cars, such as their manufacturer, model, fuel type, year of manufacture, and mileage travelled. It also includes the relevant car pricing.

Based on the features provided, the trained linear regression model will forecast car pricing. The outcomes can be viewed and studied in the ipynb notebook. The model's performance can be assessed using the R-squared (R2) score.
